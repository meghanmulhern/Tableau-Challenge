I used data from Citi Bike website and combined/cleaned the data from December 2021 and April 2021. Please see my analysis below.

1. Number of Records and Time of Year/Week
Total number of records were 45k. The average trip duration was 1,396 seconds or 23 minutes. There were more riders in April versus December, which is most likely due to lower riders during the winter months (weather related) versus in the Spring. The most popular days to ride were over the weekend versus during the work week. Saturday being the most popular day of the week followed by Saturday. Monday and Thursday were the least popular days to ride. 

2. Top/Bottom Ten Stations
The top three start and end stations were Grove St, Newport Pkwy and Liberty Light rail. 

3. Gender
More males rode citi bike versus females.
